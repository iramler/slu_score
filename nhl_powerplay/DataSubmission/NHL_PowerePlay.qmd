## Motivation

Certain infractions in a hockey game can lead to one or more players being forced to sit out for a period of time while their team has to skate with fewer payers. A common scenario that results is a 5 on 4 power play where one team has five skates (plus a goalie) and the penalized team has only four skaters (plus a goalie). The team with fewer skates is said to be shorthanded. Typical penalty times are for two minutes and the penalized player is allowed to return to the ice if the opponent scores a goal while on the power play. Rare, but more serious infractions, produce a major penalty (5 minutes) where the penalized player is not allowed to return to the ice when a goal is scored. A power play can also end before two minutes when the team on the power play commits a penalty which results in one of its players being sent off the ice to even the sides.

This dataset shows information for all 32 National Hockey League (NHL) teams based on their performance while on a 5 on 4 power play in the 2022-2023 regular season. Goals scored, shots on goals, and hits are all scaled to give a count of these events for every full two minutes of a power play.

## Data

Each row of data gives power play statistics for one of the 32 National Hockey League teams from the 2022-2023 regular season.

## Questions

1.  Are driving or putting statistics generally more effective for predicting success in a PGA tournament?

2.  Which measure of success (`avgScore`, `Money`, or `Points`) appears to be easiest to predict with either driving or putting information?

3.  For each measure of success, generate a scatterplot with one the putting or driving variables. Which of these plots suggest we might want to use a transformation of one of the variables to improve linearity?

4.  Can you find a transformation that improves the linearity of the relationship for one of the problematic cases in question #3?
