Goalkeepers are typically thought to be taller than other positions to make up in wingspan to cover the goal better. The ‘players_df’ dataset contains information on each player including their name, current club, position, and height. For this analysis, only the position and height of the player will be used. A sample of 20 players was taken from each position and will be used for this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](mpofurodrick_LATE_2917_442481_SoccerModule_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Question 1.\n\na. Calculate the mean height for each position.\n\nb. Are there any issues with the data that could affect the results?\n\nc.
